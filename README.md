# Thesis with multi-file structure and custom book style

This repository contains a minimal example of multi-file thesis structure that I created for my PhD thesis.

I also created a thesis style for UTS (`utsthesis.cls`) by modifying the book style.

DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL UTS THESIS STYLE/TEMPLATE.

This is an initial implementation, and it will most surely be updated.
